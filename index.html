            <h3>What is Stimulus?</h3>
            <p>Stimulus is a new, lightweight Javascript framework created by Basecamp. What sets it apart from other Javascript frameworks is that it does not take over the entire front-end of your project. It is designed to work with your existing HTML by connecting DOM elements with Javascript objects.</p>
