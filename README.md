# Stimulus Write-up

### What is Stimulus?

Stimulus is a new, lightweight Javascript framework created by Basecamp.  What sets it apart from other Javascript frameworks is that it does not take over the entire front-end of your project.  It is designed to work with your existing HTML by connecting DOM elements with Javascript opbjects.
